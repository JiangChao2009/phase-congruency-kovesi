# phase-congruency-kovesi
Computes edge and corner phase congruency in an image, using Peter Kovesi's algorithm and based on his Matlab code.

**I have used Peter's phase congruency in my own research on human visual perception (psychophysics & EEG):**

**Others in my field of research have also used Peter's phase congruency. Here is one example:**
